# chomsQy AI website

chomsQy.ai is built using Docsy, a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme for technical documentation sets,
providing simple navigation, site structure, and more.

## Documentation

Docsy has its own user guide (using Docsy, of course!) with lots more
information about using the theme. It is hosted by [Netlify][] at
[docsy.dev](https://docsy.dev). For deploy logs and more, see [Deploys][] from
the site's Netlify dashboard.

```console
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy.git
$ cd docsy/userguide/
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
```
