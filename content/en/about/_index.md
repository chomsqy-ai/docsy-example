Strictly speaking chomsQy AI doesn't work with simulated quantum "neural networks," rather with simulated "parameterized quantum circuits." Whereas classical computers use bits as the basic unit of information, quantum computers use the "qubit," a quantum state based method of encoding information which measures "spin" instead of "on" or "off" state. By transposing data into this state, classical computers can leverage the increased encoding capacity of quantum circuits.

## Why quantum-classical NLP?
The current state of the art in quantum computing is the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computer, and as those improve, there will be an opportunity to incorporate actual quantum circuits and data, faster processing, increased dimensionality, and other interesting things. However, since all problems will always be clasically simulable the hybrid approach is a sound solution.
